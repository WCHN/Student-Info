## Mental Health Mentoring

Mentoring is a specialist form of support that aims to help students mitigate the impact of mental health conditions whilst studying here at UCL. Mentoring involves meeting regularly with a specialist mentor and can help students to identify barriers to learning, develop study skills, and plan towards effective workload management. This service is available to all UCL students who have a registered mental health difficulty or specific learning difference.

If you would like to access mental health mentoring, please submit a query via [AskUCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/askucl) and a member of the Disability, Mental Health and Wellbeing team will be in touch with you.

### Support for students impacted by global crisis

With global conflict, civil unrest and natural disaster affecting many around the world, UCL acknowledges that this will be a challenging time for many students within our community. Students can now receive specialist therapeutic support around these issues with a focus on providing practical assistance, self-care, and coping strategies.

If you have been directly or indirectly impacted by war, civil unrest or natural disaster and would like to speak in a confidential space, please submit an enquiry via [AskUCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/askucl) and a member of the team will be in contact with you.

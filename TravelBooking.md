## Booking Travel

Any travel (trains, flights and hotel accommodation) must be booked by Kamlyn or Maddy through the UCL provider, *Clarity travel*.  Going forward, any travel and accommodation booked outside of *UCL Clarity* will only be reimbursed if approval is endorsed by Helene Crutzen, IoN Manager and the IoN Finance Team.  Please see the links below for further information when travelling on UCL Business.

# Programming guides
* [**MATLAB**](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/). The main language of [SPM](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/).
* [**Julia**](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/) + [pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLang/docs.julialang.org/assets/julia-1.7.2.pdf). A super-cool language for numerical computing - that few people use yet.
* [**Python**](https://docs.python.org/3/). A popular language with lots of libraries (including [NITorch](https://github.com/balbasty/nitorch)).
* [**Cuda**](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/). Like C, but for NVIDIA GPUs.
* [**github** (pdf)](https://githubtraining.github.io/training-manual/book.pdf). For version control.

# Support and Wellbeing
Our research student community at UCL often have difficulty in navigating the support services available to them and the Support and Wellbeing team recognise research students may be facing additional mental health challenges due to the disruption and uncertainty caused by coronavirus (COVID-19).
Here, the UCL Support and Wellbeing team have tried to pull together and explain the support services that you as research students can access and be sign posted towards along with some useful information.

This page focusses on the overarching areas supported by the [Mental Health and Wellbeing Team](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/support-and-wellbeing/wellbeing) within [Student Support and Wellbeing](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-support-and-wellbeing).

Students outside the UK should contact the [**Global Student Assistance Programme**](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/go-abroad/study-abroad-and-erasmus/while-youre-abroad/global-student-assistance-programme), providing free, confidential support, at any time of day. Research students are able to access the full offer from Care First Lifestyle as are staff. This means that as well a phone and online counselling they can receive face-to-face counselling.  To access face-to-face counselling research students need to be referred by a member of Student Support and Wellbeing (020 7679 0100 Mon-Fri 9am-5pm or via [askUCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/askucl)). Research students can of course also use Care First as all other students, which offers them a brief solution-focused therapy (BSFT) model. This is a short-term counselling approach which allows flexibility.

Modules focus on 3 overarching themes; Mental Health, Wellbeing and Chronic Health.

Support is offered face-to-face, online and via telephone. Students are required to register using an online form via askUCL to access support and all students are triaged within 24 hours by a team of duty-counsellors. Students who are deemed high risk will be contacted at this point, otherwise the average wait time for an initial appointment is 2-3 weeks. To book one of these appointments, please submit an enquiry through [askUCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/askucl).

Reasonable Adjustments can also be implemented separate to the SORA such as practical adjustments and person-based adjustments. These are funded adjustments and are also assessed and implemented by the Disability, Mental Health and Wellbeing Team.

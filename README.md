Useful links for research students at the [Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/) and the [Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research](https://www.mps-ucl-centre.mpg.de/). These two centres make up UCL's *Imaging Neuroscience* research department.

## Statistics Courses
There is an online training platform for any research student who needs to learn about research methods and statistics. The online self-paced courses are free for research students in our faculty. This programme is set up in collaboration with the Centre for Applied Statistics Courses ([CASC](www.ucl.ac.uk/stats-courses)). As a student, you can get access to a number of courses with the most recent addition being “Introduction to Meta-Analysis”. Other self-paced courses are:
* Introduction to Research Methods and Statistics
* Introduction to Regression Analysis
* Introduction to Logistic Regression
* Critical Appraisal

If you would like to access these courses please fill out [this form](https://forms.office.com/r/wvd5MDd955). Once the form is submitted a member of the stats team will be in touch to give you further details.
